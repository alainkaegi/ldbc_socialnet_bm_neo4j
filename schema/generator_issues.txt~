CONFIRMED

* In CSV files for relationships I assume the order is always from_entity|to_entity, i.e. (from)-->(to)
  But this is not documented anywhere (as far as I know), I think it should be a note in CSV-files
* Suggest removing all file descriptions from CSV-files.doc and only having general information like:
	Order of columns for relationship files is from_entity|to_entity, i.e. (from)-->(to)
	Etc.
* many relationship types are not documented in the schema table
* schema/csv documentation is inconsistent in many places (for example, attribute naming)
* post.csv CSV-file documentation is inconsistent with CSV file format
* "retweet" relationship is in schema table but not in CSV files
* Tag: (1) does not have "url" in schema table (2) in schema table it has TagClass as an attribute rather than relationship
* TagClass: does not have "url" in schema table
* I agree Email makes sense as an attribute, as multiple Person entities will not share one Email
  I disagree for Language though, because  multiple other Entities connect to it - Person, Post, Comment(?)
* Location: (1) called "Place" in schema table, should be "Location" (2) "type" attribute not mentioned in schema table, only in CSV
* Update CSV-files to remove "id" from column0 of relationship files
* The following relationship types are not documented in schema table
	repliedTo/replyOf
	locatedIn/isLocatedIn
	partOf
	knows
	speaks
	creatorOf
	hasModerator
        hasInterest
        hasTag	
	containerOf
	hasType
	isSubClassOf
* forum_hasMember_person.csv has columns:	Forum.id    Person.id    joinDate
  CSV-files.doc only documents:			Forum.id    Person.id 
* rename CSV files: 
	forum_container_of_post.csv ---> forum_containerOf_post.csv
* In CSV-files.doc it states columns are:	Person.id       Location.id
  But they are actually:			Organisation.id Location.id

TO CONFIRM

* Usually IDs in column 0 of forum.csv (and other .csv files) have 0 suffix
  In forum.csv some rows do not, for example:
	2978|Wall of Lei Liu|2010-03-11T03:55:32Z 
		Instead of
	29780|Wall of Lei Liu|2010-03-11T03:55:32Z 
  Then in files like forum_hasModerator_person.csv the ID is 29780, and lookup fails
* Usually IDs in column 0 of forum_container_of_post.csv (and other .csv files) have 0 suffix
  In column 0 of forum_container_of_post.csv some rows do not, for example:
	50294
		Instead of
	502940
  Then when trying to retrieve 50294 (probably supposed to be 502940) from forum.csv it is not found

Notes
	Query descriptions
	Substitutions
		Which parameters
		From which dictionaries
		From which ranges
	What will change in the near future
		DBGEN will generate JSON file with content of all dictionaries
	What can I use now to implement a workload with a small amount of queries
